    <h1>{{APP_NAME}}</h1>
    <p>{{APP_NAME}} was developed in 2018 by the NSW Office of Environment and Heritage (OEH)
        for the collection of koala observation and survey data.</p>

    <p>All data submitted via this app is made available by OEH though BioNet, NSW’s
        corporate biodiversity data repository. BioNet data is accessible to researchers,
        land managers, government agencies and the public via the BioNet website
        <a href="https://www.bionet.nsw.gov.au/">www.bionet.nsw.gov.au</a>.</p>

    <p>Once submitted, koala data is uploaded to BioNet overnight, and is available
        the next day.</p>

    <p>Koala data helps inform environmental managers, land managers and the community
        about koala numbers, distribution and habitat, and assists the implementation of long term conservation strategies to secure healthy koala populations in the wild.</p>
